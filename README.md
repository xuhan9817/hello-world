# hello-world
Hello!

I am completing my masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics at UCSD. After finishing my Bachelor of Science in Supply Chain Management from Rutgers University, I developed good business sense and project management skills. Now I am working hard to hone my programming and data analysis skills, and looking for opportunities for a summer internship as a business analyst to contribute myself.
